# tic<sup>3</sup>

tic<sup>3</sup> (pronounced "tick cubed") is a variant of 3D ultimate tic-tac-toe.

## How to play

- The board is divided into 3x3x3 "supercubes", which each contain 3x3x3 "subcubes".

- If you win three subcubes in a line, you win the corresponding supercube.

- If you win three supercubes in a line, you win the game.

- The subcube that you select determines which supercube your opponent will play in next.

- If you send your opponent to a completed supercube, they can play anywhere.

- You may not play in the centre supercube on the first turn of the game.
